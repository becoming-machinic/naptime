Becoming Machinic is pleased to announce that our [NAPTIME](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/naptime) library is now open source under the [Apache 2 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

Typically, making API calls to external REST endpoints from the IBM i required installing either Python or node.js. With the SENDREQ command provided by the NAPTIME library, these calls can be made, via HTTP or HTTPS, directly from your RPG or CLLE programs.

Our customers utilize NAPTIME to integrate their IBM i applications with their business processes on machinic.io or our Nomad virtual appliance, but SENDREQ can be used with any HTTP or HTTPS endpoint.

If your company is currently needing business process solutions to integrate with your IBM i infrastructure, please contact us at [sales@machinic.io](mailto:sales@machinic.io) or (612) 428-0415 x3086.
